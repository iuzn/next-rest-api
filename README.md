# Next.js API Routes for Building a RESTful API

---

Welcome to a comprehensive starter template designed to facilitate the creation of a RESTful API using Next.js API routes. The objective is to leverage the potential of Next.js, a renowned framework widely adopted for crafting server-side rendered React applications, in developing a RESTful API. The repository features a well-organized, extensible, and scalable blueprint for structuring your API endpoints, empowered by the prowess of Next.js.

## Initialization

Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iuzn/next-rest-api.git
```

2. Transition into the project directory:

```shell
cd next-rest-api
```

3. Proceed to install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
pnpm i
// or alternatively,
yarn
```

4. Initiate the development server:

```shell
pnpm dev
// or alternatively,
yarn dev
```

## Project Structure

The pivotal file for initial modifications is `src/app/api/route.ts`.

A basic overview of the project structure is provided below:

```
next-rest-api/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   ├── route.ts
├── eslintrc.json
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js
├── next-env.d.ts
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

## API Documentation

Every API endpoint is defined as a function within `src/app/api/route.ts`. The structure of this file has been conceived to be highly scalable and flexible, enabling seamless addition of new routes as your application evolves.

For an in-depth understanding of how to add routes or structure your requests, consult the [Next.js API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes).

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on any platform that provides support for Next.js, including Vercel or Netlify.
